* Lectures: 4:10-5:25pm on Mondays & Wednesdays, Room 825 in the Seeley W. Mudd Building.
* Exercise sessions: to be determined.
* Instructor: [Thibault Vatter](https://tvatter.github.io), [tv2233@columbia.edu](tv2233@columbia.edu)
* TA: [Thomas Leavitt](http://polisci.columbia.edu/people/profile/1500), [tl2624@columbia.edu](tl2624@columbia.edu)

This course introduces students to (i) basic mathematical tools frequently used in political science and (ii) approaches to mathematical proofs. The course, or knowledge of the mathematics taught, is a prerequisite for the advanced statistics (POLS 4912) and formal modeling courses (POLS 4210). 

The course has two equally important components:

* **Lectures with the instructor** focus on introducing the new concepts with references to practical or theoretical issues and deriving the main theoretical results.
* **Exercise sessions with the TA** focus on clarifying and illustrating the theoretical concepts, improving your mathematical problem-solving skills, help you with the problem sets, and offer preparation for the midterm and final exams.

### Grading

* Homework assignments (20%). 
* Midterm exam (40%).
* Final exam (40%).

I recommend you work on your own and only consult your friends or us if you get stuck. In any case, you must write your own solutions. I will hand out six problem sets.

If your performance in the final is significantly better than in the midterm, I will give a higher weight on the final than on the midterm. This policy rewards improved performance over the duration of the class.

Your final grade may be anywhere between an F and an A+, depending exclusively on how well you perform in the problem sets and exams. The final grade for this class is based on academic performance only. I will absolutely not consider your degree requirements or the implications of a low grade for your academic or professional future. If you are not willing to accept this grading policy, then you should not enroll in this class. Grade appeals are only considered based on clear, documented errors in grading. All other grade appeals are automatically rejected.

If you have a disability or a medical condition that requires special accommodations for an exam, you should provide documentation in advance of the exam.

### Prerequisites

No prior knowledge of calculus or linear algebra is necessary. However, students are assumed to have a firm command of basic high school algebra. If your foundational mathematical skills are weak, this class will be very difficult and frustrating for you.

### Prerequisites

No mandatory textbook, all the material will be provided.

### Schedule 

This is a **TENTATIVE** schedule for the course. The exact dates for each topic 
will depend on progress and integration may start before the midterm.

* Befor Midterm
  * **Linear Algebra.** Matrices; matrix operations; inverses
of matrices; solutions to systems of linear equations.
  * **Differential Calculus.** Sequences and limits; continuity;
differentiability; derivatives; functions and correspondences.
* After Midterm
  * **Integration.** Concept of integral; common integrals; integration
by parts.
  * **Optimization.** Unconstrained optimization; first and second order conditions;
Constrained optimization; Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions.
  * **Probability and statistics.** Elements of combinatorics and probabilities; random variables; limits of variable random variables; descriptive statistics; statistical inference.

### Office Hours

To be determined.
